# MewX's blog reworked v3

**Working in progress**

In this version, I plan to use Jekyll/Liquid + Vuejs + Googe Material Design UI + KotlinJS.

## Plans for current version

- use svg icons
- text searchable
- github activities
- social icons updated
- copyleft and proudly using xxx :P
- project pages with project short highlights
- update-to-date CV
- contributes to open source repo (with issue id)
- check all friend website links
- emoticon support!!! That would be funny!
- fix link address (with slash or not should work both)
