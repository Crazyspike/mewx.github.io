I really love Material Design since I wrote the [Wenku8 Android app](https://wenku8.mewx.org/).
So, in this version, I used [Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/) from Google, and [anime.js](http://animejs.com/) to rebuild the page layout.
Also, source codes are hosted on [my GitHub](https://github.com/MewX/mewx.github.io).

History versions can be found at the fantastic web archive!
